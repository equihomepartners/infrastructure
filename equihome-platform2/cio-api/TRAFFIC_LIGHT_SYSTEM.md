# Equihome Traffic Light Zoning System

## Overview
The Traffic Light Zoning System is the core of Equihome's investment thesis, using ML/AI to analyze geographic areas and determine investment viability through a simple but powerful traffic light classification system.

## Zoning Analysis Architecture

### 1. Geographic Data Processing
- **Zip Code Level Analysis**
  - Property market metrics
  - Economic indicators
  - Demographic trends
  - Housing supply/demand

- **Neighborhood Level Analysis**
  - Property condition clusters
  - Income stability metrics
  - Development patterns
  - Local market dynamics

### 2. ML-Driven Zone Classification

#### Green Zones (Optimal Investment Areas)
```
Criteria → ML Analysis → Risk Score → Classification
```
- Strong appreciation potential
- Stable or growing population
- High employment stability
- Low default risk metrics
- Positive economic indicators
- Healthy price-to-rent ratios
- Strong property demand

#### Yellow Zones (Watch Areas)
```
Criteria → ML Analysis → Risk Score → Classification
```
- Moderate appreciation potential
- Stable population
- Mixed employment metrics
- Medium default risk
- Neutral economic indicators
- Average price-to-rent ratios
- Balanced supply/demand

#### Red Zones (No-Investment Areas)
```
Criteria → ML Analysis → Risk Score → Classification
```
- Declining property values
- Population decrease
- Employment instability
- High default risk
- Negative economic trends
- Poor price-to-rent ratios
- Oversupply issues

### 3. Real-time Monitoring System

#### Data Collection (5-minute intervals)
- Market transactions
- Economic updates
- Property listings
- Local news events
- Policy changes

#### Zone Status Updates (15-minute intervals)
- Risk score recalculation
- Zone classification review
- Threshold monitoring
- Alert generation

### 4. Investment Decision Support

#### Portfolio Allocation Rules
- **Green Zones**
  - Primary investment focus
  - Higher allocation limits
  - Aggressive growth strategy
  - Maximum exposure thresholds

- **Yellow Zones**
  - Limited investment
  - Strict monitoring
  - Conservative approach
  - Lower allocation limits

- **Red Zones**
  - No new investments
  - Exit strategy if existing
  - Monitor for improvement
  - Risk mitigation plans
