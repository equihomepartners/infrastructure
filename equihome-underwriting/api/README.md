# Equihome Underwriting API Backend Development

## Overview
The Underwriting API processes loan applications from homeowners, integrates with the CIO API for risk assessment, and manages the underwriting decision process. This system handles the automated evaluation of loan applications while incorporating ML-driven insights from the CIO system.

## System Architecture

### 1. Application Processing
- **Loan Application Handling**
  - Application submission
  - Document processing
  - Status tracking
  - Decision management

- **Processing Pipeline**
  - Initial validation
  - CIO risk assessment integration
  - Automated evaluation
  - Decision generation

### 2. Integration with CIO System
- **Risk Assessment**
  - Market condition analysis
  - Property evaluation
  - Risk scoring
  - ML model integration

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Application Management
```
POST /api/applications/submit
GET /api/applications/:id
GET /api/applications/status/:id
PUT /api/applications/:id/update
```

#### Underwriting Process
```
POST /api/underwriting/evaluate
GET /api/underwriting/criteria
GET /api/underwriting/decision/:id
POST /api/underwriting/documents
```

#### Integration Endpoints
```
GET /api/risk/assessment/:id
GET /api/market/conditions
POST /api/cio/analysis
```
